This folder contains some useful VMD plugins.

bfactor is a very simple tcl script that just scales the Bfactor in
VMD by a user inputed value and allows display.

connectivity is a tcl script called from VMD which plots the residue
connectivity within a given cutoff onto the structure. It also contains
a function to calculate the whole molecule mass.

hingefind is a slightly modified version of the code written by
Willy Wriggers 
(http://www.netsci.org/Resources/Software/Modeling/Biop/hingefind.html)
which I like and is a useful tool if looking for large domain blocks
for use with the DIAGRTB program in this toolbox.

nmwiz0.2 is an early version of nmwiz 
(http://www.csb.pitt.edu/ProDy/plugins/index.html) which I
know works with the NMWIZWT program in this toolbox.
